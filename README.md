# Automatic Earthquake Declustering with Susceptibility Index
This repository contains the code for the project "Determining the number of clusters using the Similarity Matrix".
The code and proposed algorithm can be used in any type of dataset. In this project, two papers have been published:

### This code was written for the following articles:

Eugenio Lippiello, Polyzois Bountzis, Silvio Baccari 2023;<br/>Determining the number of clusters, before finding clusters,
from the susceptibility of the similarity matrix.<br/>
_Physica A_; doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2023.128592<br/>
<br/>

### The earthquake declustering problem is described in:

Polyzois Bountzis, Eugenio Lippiello, Silvio Baccari, Giueseppe Petrillo 202X;<br/>Automatic Earthquake Declustering Using The Nearest-Neighbor Distance.<br/>
_JGR_; doi: https://doi.org/XXXXXXX<br/>
